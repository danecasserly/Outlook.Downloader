# Outlook.Downloader
A VSTO addin allowing users to easily download and attach a URL in an email to the said email.

Itâ€™s a really simple little add-in I wrote to help me out when sending files from internal systems to external users.

For example say you have a link to an internal SharePoint document that you need to send to an outside customer that does not have access to your
internal systems.. you just add the link in your email and click download it downloads the file and attaches it.
